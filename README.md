Credit card fraud is a growing problem due to the expansion of modern technologies and communication. It costs consumers and financial institutions billions of dollars annually.
Detecting and preventing fraud is challenging and expensive. Common techniques like Na√Øve Bayes, Support Vector Machines, and K-Nearest Neighbor algorithms are used, but they have weaknesses, including an imbalance in data.
To enhance fraud detection, we propose adding a face recognition module for doubtful transactions. Our project focuses on credit card fraud, experimenting with different data sampling techniques and classifier algorithms to find the most effective approach.
